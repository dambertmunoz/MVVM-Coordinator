# Kavak Challengue

Challengue with MVVM


## Extra Feature
* Save books with RealM. Use repository pattern to save books when only is needed. The firstime connect to backend API to recovery the data and after that only will use the data stored.
* Add target for SwiftLint
* Just I created one unit test. I didn't have much time, sorry about that. 


## Dependencies Swift Package Manager

* Kingfisher - Cache Images
* Realm, RealmDatabase - Used to save books 
* RxSwift - Used to MVVM binding with viewmodels.


## Internal frameworks Dependencies - Swift Package Manager

* Sources/MVVMUtils - Some contants. Created for demostrate to I know about modularization in Swift Package Manager for this case.   Also know support to Carthage when It's needed.



# I work with gitflow. Check the branches pls.
